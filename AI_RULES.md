# bobbai - AI Rules

## Project Constraints

When updating or modifying this project, strictly follow these rules:

1. **Only 1 index.html file** - All content and styles in a single HTML file (inline `<style>`)
2. **NO JavaScript** - Use only HTML and CSS (CSS-only interactions allowed)
4. **Only 3 colors:**
   - `#1a1512` - Dark coffee brown (background)
   - `#d7ccc8` - Cream (primary text)
   - `#ffb3c1` - Soft pink (accents)

5. **List item titles max 50 characters** - Titles must not line-break on desktop (700px layout)
6. **Doomsday indicators** - When adding articles, auto-apply these classes:
   - `clock-tick` — articles about AI existential risk, accelerating AI capabilities, or the doomsday clock moving closer (shows ☢)
   - `clock-tick skull` — articles specifically about job cuts/layoffs caused by AI (shows †)

## Purpose

A chronological feed of daily discoveries (books, movies, articles, podcasts, tools) with CSS-only category filtering.

## Doomsday Clock Pages

The `/clock/` directory contains auto-generated HTML pages produced by a GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/doomsday-clock.yml`). These pages are **not hand-edited** — they are generated by `.github/scripts/doomsday_clock.py` using the template at `.github/scripts/clock_template.html`. The action runs weekly (Mondays) and can be triggered manually. It queries 4 AI models via OpenRouter and aggregates their scores.
