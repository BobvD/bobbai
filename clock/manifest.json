      "consensus_summary": "The clock edges closer to midnight at 11:56:43 as three converging threats dominated the week: Block's staggering 40% workforce reduction established a market-rewarded template for mass AI displacement, the Trump administration blacklisted Anthropic from all government contracts after the company refused to strip safety guardrails from Pentagon AI systems, and Anthropic reportedly dropped its flagship safety pledge, removing one of the industry's most important private-sector commitments. The weighted score of 7.06 reflects a world where AI-driven job elimination is now being openly celebrated by markets, the U.S. government is actively punishing safety compliance, and the guardrails meant to prevent catastrophic misuse are being dismantled from both sides\u2014leaving the trajectory unmistakably pointed toward midnight."
